step 1: Create input.txt and output.txt file in the same directory and saved.

step 2: Use this build:

{
  "shell_cmd": "javac -Xlint  \"${file}\"",
  "file_regex": "^(...*?):([0-9]*):?([0-9]*)",
  "working_dir": "${file_path}",
  "selector": "source.java",

   "variants": [

  { "shell_cmd":"javac -Xlint  \"${file}\" && java $file_base_name  < input.txt > output.txt",
  "name": "Run"
  }
 ]
 }


step 3: Save this sublime build and run the program with ctrl + shift + B with run variant. Without run variant it will just create .class file but wont run it.

step 4: This build will read the input from input.txt and print the output in output.txt.

Note: Both input.txt and output.txt must be present in the same working directory as your .java file.
