import pyperclip

''' Sometimes you may want to strip off whitespace characters (space, tab, 
    and newline) from the left side, right side, or both sides of a string. 
    The strip() string method will return a new string without any whitespace
    characters at the beginning or end. The lstrip() and rstrip() methods
    will remove whitespace characters from the left and right ends, respectively.
'''

spam = '    Hello World    '
spam.strip()  #'Hello World' #strip both side

spam.lstrip() #'Hello World    ' #strip left side

spam.rstrip() #'    Hello World' #strip right side

spam = 'SpamSpamBaconSpamEggsSpamSpam'
spam.strip('ampS') #'BaconSpamEggs'        #strip from both side of string
